# ND_ICG_2020_Practical_One
Practical One for Introduction to Computational Genomics

This practical is intended to get you used to github submission of lab practicals. Submit your answer to the practical as a script "practical.sh" in the future all practicals will be submitted with a "practical.sh" which will call any other code/libraries that you need to take the practical. 

Clone this repository, create your own branch (your netid) and modify the practical.sh script to :

1. Output to the command line the branch and whether or not your branch is up to date with the master branch. 
2. List every commit, but only the last two changes in each commit. 
3. List all branches that have not been merged in the current repository. 
4. List the author of the first line of practical.sh

Once you have completed a script that outputs these answers push your branch to this repository with your modified script.
